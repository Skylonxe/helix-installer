#  		Path:   For change-*, edge-*, or shelve-* triggers, a pattern
#			to match files in the changelist.
#
#			For form-* triggers, the type of form: e.g. 'branch'
#			'client', etc.
#
#			For fix-* triggers use 'fix'.
#
#			For auth-* triggers use 'auth'.
#
#			For graph-* triggers use a pattern to match repo names.
#
#			For archive triggers, a file pattern to match the
#			file name being accessed.
#
#			For command triggers, the client command to match.
#			Must be in the form "(pre|post)-user-$command",
#			e.g. "pre-user-tag".  The command name is a regular
#			expression.  See "p4 help grep" for details on
#			syntax.
#
#			For journal-rotate* triggers, use 'any' or either the
#			server.id or cluster.id of the server(s) that
#			should run the triggers.
#
#  		Command: The OS command to run for validation.  If the
#			 command contains spaces, the whole command must
#			 be quoted.  See 'p4 help triggers' for a list of
#			 variables that can be expanded in the command
#			 string.
#
#  For example,
#
#	Triggers:
#		cscheck change-submit //depot/... "cmd %changelist%"
#		no-oblits command pre-user-obliterate fail
#		mkspec form-out client "%quote%//trig/scr.pl%quote%"
#		daily_verify bgtask unset "verify.pl"
#
# See 'p4 help triggers' for more information about triggers.
