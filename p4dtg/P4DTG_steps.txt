----------- P4 CLIENT (with GUI support) --------------
(superuser should be logged in with environement variables set)
p4 jobspec
<- copy content of jobspec file into opened txt editor

----------- P4DTG HOST (with GUI support) -------------
install P4DTG (requires java)
copy attached config folder to its install location (it is good starting point for configuration, some fields like Status can depend on user language settings)

add to jira-rest-config.xml if it is not there (Otherwise swarm is crashing because of @ in username) :
<Config>
	<JiraHandling>
	      <UserStyle>name,emailshort,displayname,email</UserStyle>
	</JiraHandling>

apply p4dtg jira patch
adjust confiugration using p4dtg config exe (requires run as admin)
test if replication works correctly (I had to stop service manually in windows services and change user from local service account to the actual user, Sync from start date checkbox enabled)
stop replication

----------- P4DTG HOST (IF USING LINUX) -------------
cd /home/perforce
wget http://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r18.1/bin.linux26x86_64/p4dtg.tgz
tar zxvf p4dtg.tgz
rm p4dtg.tgz
mv p4dtg-* p4dtg
sudo apt install default-jre -y
apply p4dtg jira patch (https://forums.perforce.com/index.php?/topic/6501-p4dtg-jira-not-working-statuscodeoptionalabsent/) (copy jira folder to server and override it)
copy p4dtg config from GUI machine to this host
cd /home/perforce
chmod -R +w p4dtg
chown perforce p4dtg -R
cd /etc/systemd/system
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylonxe/helix-installer/master/p4dtg/p4dtg.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable p4dtg
sudo systemctl restart p4dtg

---------- SWARM HOST (IF USING SWARM) --------------

nano /opt/perforce/swarm/data/config.php

 'jira' => array(
        'host'      => 'https://xxxxx.atlassian.net:443', // URL for your installed JIRA web interface
        'user'      => 'mail@mail.com', // the username required for JIRA API access
        'password'  => 'TOKEN_FOR_ATLASSIAN', // the password required for JIRA API access
        'job_field' => 'DTG_DTISSUE', // optional, if P4DTG is replicating JIRA issue IDs
                           // to a job field, list that field here
        'link_to_jobs'    => true, // set to true to enable Perforce job links in JIRA, P4DTG and job_field required
        'delay_job_links' => 60, // delay in seconds, defaults to 60 seconds
        'relationship'    => '', // subsection name for Perforce job links
                                 // defaults to empty, Perforce job links added to the "links to" subsection
    ),

curl -u "admin:admin" -X DELETE "https://swarm.ondrejhrusovsky.com/api/v9/cache/config/"
systemctl restart apache2

TROUBLESHOOTING

P4DTG Error: Character reference "&#x1E" is an invalid XML character - https://community.perforce.com/s/article/3577 - copy config folder again from verified working Windows P4DTG

SWARM is spamming Jira ticket history every x minutes: Make sure no field is constantly updating. Copying Updated field can cause infinite loop of history updates for the tickets.

Error from check_connection: [UsageError]******* WARNING P4PORT IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! *******
It is possible that someone is intercepting your connection
to the Perforce P4PORT '0.0.0.0:1666'
If this is not a scheduled key change, then you should contact
your Perforce administrator.
The fingerprint for the mismatched key sent to your client is
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Usually happens after ssl perforce certificate update. Add Environment=P4TRUST=/home/perforce/p4dtg/p4trust to your p4dtg.service file. Make sure it points to your correct p4trust location. I copied p4trust from Helix Swarm from /opt/perforce/swarm/data/p4trust. There is probably a way how to generate a new one but I did not investigate.

P4DTG is ignoring some tickets on restart after failure: p4dtg/config/set-JIRA.xml contains times of last P4 and JIRA pooling. It is possible these times are past the moment when P4DTG failure happened. On restart P4DTG won't check ticket changes older than dates listed there. I usually change the dates there to make sure it will go over all recent changes again (for example by changing year to previous year).
